# Bill Split Calculator
#### _This python script calculates the amount of bill each person should pay when splitting bills_

Bill Split Calculator is a fun project I coded when I was initially learning python. I decided to publish some of my earlier codes during my python journey. Hence this!

## Tech
- [Python] - This script requires only python to run

## Usage
- It's best used when you want to split bills in a restaurant with a group of friends or in a similar situation and you don't want to bother with all the calculations involved
